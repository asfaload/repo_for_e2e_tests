# repo_for_e2e_tests
This is a repo that is used in [Asfaload](https://github.com/asfaload/asfaload) end-to-end validation tests. It does not contain anything of interest.

There are signers files registered in branches, and releases with artifacts. All those are used to test repo and releases registration to the Asfaload backend.
